# Session11

Designing my own CNN architecture to run on CIFAR 10 dataset and experimenting on effects over accuracy by making following changes to neural net
-Using Image Normalization
-Making use of Batch Normalization
-Making use of L2 Regularizer
-Properly using Dropout
-Removed Dense layers
-Overall reduced number of parameters from 1,172,410 to 290,090
